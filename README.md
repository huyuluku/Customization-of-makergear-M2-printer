In this project, our group customized a makergear M2 FDM printer into a 3 channel DIW printer.
The work in mainly done by Matthew Sorna from Architected Materials Lab at University of Pennsylvania.
Building on Matthew's work, I have been responsible for maintaining the machine and have made several improvements. 
Additionally, based on my own requirements, I modified another MakerGear M2 printer into a dual-channel DIW printer.
